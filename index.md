# Sustainable Waste Resource Recovery Lab

The Sustainable Waste Resource Recovery Lab (SWR2L) is a research group led by Dr. Xavier Fonoll Almansa in the Fariborz Maseeh Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering.  
We use microbial community engineering, environmental and cost analyses to develop sustainable chemical and biological processes that recover resources from wastes and remove emerging contaminants and pathogens.  
We collaborate with utilities, industry, national laboratories and other academic institutions.

## Research Mission
We do research to make engineered systems more sustainable and resilient and to protect the environment and the health of all individuals, in cities and remote areas.  
We engineer microbial communities through process design and use modeling tools to ensure process sustainability.

## Teaching Mission
We train the next generation of scientists and engineers on chemical and biotechnology processes to recover resources from wastewater and solid wastes.  
Dr. Fonoll Almansa combines traditional and active learning techniques while fostering an inclusive environment.

## Group Culture
Our group is based on peer mentoring and is driven by curiosity towards science.  
We foster an inclusive environment to welcome new members and collaborators.
