# Research Projects

## Feasibility Study to Implement Hydrothermal Liquefaction in Southeast Michigan
**Funding:** DOE  
Collaboration with GLWA, PNNL, Brown and Caldwell, Genifuel, University of Michigan, Wayne State.  
We perform LCA, techno-economic analysis, social assessment and pilot tests.

## Treatment and Resource Recovery from HTL Aqueous By-product
**Funding:** DOE, WRF, GLWA  
Recovering biogas & ammonia via anaerobic digestion and chemical processes.  
Testing in bioreactors simulating activated sludge.

## Evaluating Transformation and Fate of PFAS During HTL of Sewage Sludge
**Funding:** DOE  
Testing PFAS fate in Genifuelâ€™s pilot and continuous HTL reactors.

## Evaluating Nitrification Inhibition by Propylene Glycol
**Funding:** City of Austin (Austin Water)  
Using bench-scale bioreactors to study nitrifying bacteria inhibition.

## Unleashing Anaerobic Fungi in Anaerobic Digestion
**Funding:** UT Austin  
Simulating rumen conditions to grow anaerobic fungi for lignocellulose digestion.
